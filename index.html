            <p>A common meme in the gaming community is "If you die in the game, you die in real life". 
                Well, Palmer Luckey developed a Virtual Reality headset that does just that. Inspired by Sword Art Online, 
                the headset is laced with charges that will explode if they trigger an “appropriate game over” screen. 
                Even though this headset is more of a gimmick, and I hope that it doesn't actually become a product that those can buy,
                the concept is wild. Having a physical consequence while playing video games, adds a sense of importance to not lose.
                Technology is ever-changing, either for the good or bad; it just depends on how we use it.
