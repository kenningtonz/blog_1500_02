            <p>A common meme in the gaming community is "If you die in the game, you die in real life". 
                Well, Palmer Luckey developed a Virtual Reality headset that does just that. Inspired by Sword Art Online, 
                the headset is laced with charges that will explode if they trigger an “appropriate game over” screen. 
                Even though this headset is more of a gimmick, and I hope that it doesn't actually become a product that those can buy,
                the concept is wild. Having a physical consequence while playing video games, adds a sense of importance to not lose.
                Technology is ever-changing, either for the good or bad; it just depends on how we use it.

            <h2>Man Boasts About Winning Art Competition Using AI-Created Image</h2>

            <p>As technology advances, how we use it advances as well. Jason Allen entered an art competition in Colorado using an image generated by an AI.
                MidJourney is an AI that generates images from just a line of text. The piece Allan submitted won first place and he received $750.
                He submitted the peice with "via MidJourney" in the name, but did not specify what that meant or what the program could do.
                In my opinion, art that was made by an AI should not be compared to human created art. 
                As our technology advances, we need to think about how we approach it, compared to previous ways.
