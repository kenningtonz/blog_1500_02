            <p>A common meme in the gaming community is "If you die in the game, you die in real life". 
                Well, Palmer Luckey developed a Virtual Reality headset that does just that. Inspired by Sword Art Online, 
                the headset is laced with charges that will explode if they trigger an “appropriate game over” screen. 
                Even though this headset is more of a gimmick, and I hope that it doesn't actually become a product that those can buy,
                the concept is wild. Having a physical consequence while playing video games, adds a sense of importance to not lose.
                Technology is ever-changing, either for the good or bad; it just depends on how we use it.

            <h2>Man Boasts About Winning Art Competition Using AI-Created Image</h2>

            <p>As technology advances, how we use it advances as well. Jason Allen entered an art competition in Colorado using an image generated by an AI.
                MidJourney is an AI that generates images from just a line of text. The piece Allan submitted won first place and he received $750.
                He submitted the peice with "via MidJourney" in the name, but did not specify what that meant or what the program could do.
                In my opinion, art that was made by an AI should not be compared to human created art. 
                As our technology advances, we need to think about how we approach it, compared to previous ways.

            <h2>Amazon’s recent experiment here in Ontario shows how big tech can help vulnerable seniors</h2>

            <time>November 19th, 2022</time>
            <p> Amazon has begun testing with putting an Amazon Alexa into senior homes. 
                The device is placed into the rooms of assisted living facilities and assists with the lights and calling family members. 
                Using voice as an interface is is much easier becuase it requires no manual skills other then talking.
                Of course using a device like this brings privacy concerns to the table, but this can make the lives of these people much easier.
                I think this is a great idea, and could be very helpful. As technology advances we have to think of the practical positive uses of it.

                    <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/11/18/pokemon-scarlet-violet-graphics-glitches-problems/">Article link here</a>

                    <p>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet was released in November and it should have been released next year. 
                        I had the opporunitiy to play the game on release day. For a game relased in 2022, it graphicaly looks like a PlayStation 2 game.
                    The graphical glitches and frame drops cannot be excused. But aposed to the title of this article, it is not GameFreak's fault.
                I have done a bit more research and according to beta testers on Twitter, GameFreak didn't want to release the game yet, but The Pokemon Company pressured them to.
            This is unfortunate as the game is super fun to play but would be rated much higher if the developers just had more time.</p>
